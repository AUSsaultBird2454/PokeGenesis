balance, and in general conduct themselves 
physically with swiftness and grace. 
Characters with a high Acrobatics Rank tend

character’s ability to hide, sneak, and
generally move and act undetected. Stealth

or as field researchers studying reclusive or 
violent Pokémon.</Description>

        <Description>Focus is a Spirit Skill that represents a 
character’s ability to concentrate on 
difficult or complex tasks or to work under 
pain and stress. It can be thought of as 
analogous to willpower, and characters with a 
high Focus Rank are often intensely driven and 
ambitious, or at the least unshakable once 
they’ve dedicated themselves to a task.</Description>
