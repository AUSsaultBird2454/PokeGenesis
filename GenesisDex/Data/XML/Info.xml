    <Capability name="Aura Reader">
      <Description>These Trainers and Pokemon 
can read the Auras of other living beings.

sour mood or deceptive and negative
intentions.,</Description>

      <Description>Pokemon with the 
Illusionist Capability can create 
minor visual Illusions as a Standard 
Action. These may be no more than 
half a meter in any dimension and 
produce no sensory sensations 
outside of sight. Any physical 
contact noticeably disrupts an 
Illusion, and all other effects 
that see through Illusions can do 
so. Otherwise, the Illusion appears 
life-like and can be made to move, 
though it cannot move further than 
the user's Focus Rank in meters away 
from the user. Actively manipulating the 
Illusion requires constant attention 
from the user. For minor effects such as 
making an illusionary flame dance, this 
requires the user to constantly spend 
its Swift Actions. For more major effects 
such as animating an illusionary skeleton, 
the user must constantly spend Standard Actions.

    </Capability>
    <Capability name="Keystone Warp">
      <Description>Spiritomb carries around with it 
an Odd Keystone. Trainers may collect additional 
Odd Keystones as they travel. They may then

    <Capability name="Letter Press">
      <Description>Unown with the Letter Press 
capability may be combined with other Unown, 
creating a Prime Unown, or adding to an 
existing Prime Unown. The first four times 
you add an Unown to a Prime Unown, including 
the creation of the Prime Unown, add 5 points 
to any one of the Prime Unown's Base stats. 
Combined Unown may retain different instances 
of Hidden Power from each individual Unown, 
up the normal Move List limit. When combining 
Unown with the Letter Press capability, for 
each instance of Hidden Power, choose whether 
it will operate on Attack stat or Special 
Attack stat. This choice is permanent. Unowns 
combined with Letter Press can be kept in a 
single Poke Ball, essentially becoming a single 
Pokemon. Once combined with Letter Press, 
Unowns cannot be separated. Prime Unown lose 
the Underdog Capability.,</Description>
    </Capability>
    <Capability name="Living Weapon">
      <Description>In addition to being a Pokemon,
Honedge and its evolutionary relatives also 
count as equipment and may be used as such 
if the Pokemon is willing. Honedge may be 
used as a Small Melee Weapon. Doublade may 
be used as two Small Melee Weapons; when 
one is held in each hand, the user gains +2 
to Evasion. Aegislash may be used as a Small 
Melee Weapon and a Light Shield. When Fainted, 
these Pokemon may still be used as inanimate 
pieces of equipment, but all rolls made with 
them take a -2 penalty. If the Living Weapon 
is also being used as an active Pokemon, the 
Wielder and the Living Weapon use the Wielder's 
Movement Speed to shift during each of their turns,
and the total amount Shifted during the round cannot
exceed the Wielder's Movement Speed. While wielded,
the Living Weapon may impart its wielder benefits
as if it were a Simple or Fine Weapon, as long as
the wielder has the requisite Combat Skill Rank.
A Honedge counts as a Simple Weapon and grants the
Adept Move Wounding Strike. A Do blade counts as a
Simple Weapon and Grants the Adept Move Double Swipe.
An Aegislash counts as a Fine Weapon and grants the
Adept Move Wounding Strike and the Master Move Bleed!
While used as a Living Weapon, the Pokemon also adds
these Moves to its own Move List, so long as their
wielder qualifies to access them. Either the Living Weapon
or the Wielder can disengage as a Swift Action during
their turn to Shift and attack separately. Re-engaging 
is a Standard Action that may be taken by either party. 
While Wielded, a Living Weapon cannot benefit from its 
No Guard Ability, and an Aegislash is automatically
in Blade forme.,</Description>
    </Capability>
    <Capability name="Magnetic">
      <Description>Magnetic Pokemon can lightly manipulate 
magnetic fields. With this, they can repel or attract
iron and/or steel, holding it to their body or pushing
it away. Through this magnetic manipulation, they can
also feel magnetic fields and discern magnetic north.
If a Pokemon learns the Move Magnet Rise or Magnet
Bomb, or gains the Magnet Pull Ability, and does not
have the Magnetic Capability, they gain Magnetic.,</Description>
    </Capability>
    <Capability name="Marsupial">
      <Description>Kangaskhan is always born with the
Baby Template (see Optional Rules), subtracting
5 from each of its Base Stats. While Kangaskhan
have the Baby Template, they live in their mother's
pouch and will not willingly leave it for long;
their bond is so strong, that both Pokemon are
able to be captured in a single Pokeball during
this time. While Kangaskhan has the Baby Template,
it cannot be Commanded to fight or take any action.
Mother Kangaskhan with a Baby in their pouch are
exceptional at protecting their babies; attacks cannot
target Kangaskhan inside their mother's pouch while
she is conscious. Trainers raising a Kangaskhan may
choose to have their Mother Kangaskhan gain 20% less 
experience from any sources and give that Experience
to the baby instead. Once a Baby Kangaskhan reaches 
level 25 and loses the Baby Template, it exits its 
mother's pouch permanently. If its mother had a 
loyalty higher than 1, it will allow itself to be 
easily caught by its Trainer.,</Description>

trigger on their attacks. The Dream Reader
Capability cannot read their dreams.,</Description>
    </Capability>
    <Capability name="Mountable X">
      <Description>This Pokemon may serve as a mount 
for X average Trainers regardless of Power 
Capability and ignoring penalties for weight
carried. This Capability fails to function 
if significant weight is added in addition 
to the Trainer(s). Note that this Capability
is meant to be used as a guideline, not a

Pack Mon instinctively
belong to a rigid pack
structure, and are naturally
inclined to the top of that
structure. Wild Pokemon
that are of this Pokemon's 
unevolved form or at
least 10 levels lower than
the user will instantly
obey the user's commands;
showing a Pokemon with
Pack Mon to a group of 
Wilds will put them at a Fearful
disposition. However, 
two Pack Mons of the same species
and within 10 Levels of
each other will fight for
dominance of the group.
If a Wild Pack Leader is ten 
levels higher than your Pokemon,
it will expect your 
Pokemon to obey it, and may attack 
if it does not.,</Description>
    </Capability>
    <Capability name="Pearl Creation">
      <Description>When a Pokemon with 
this Capability Evolves,
it loses this Capability and
creates a Pink Pearl Held Item.,</Description>
    </Capability>
    <Capability name="Phasing">
      <Description>A Pokemon with Phasing

again is a Shift Action.,</Description>
    </Capability>
    <Capability name="Planter">
      <Description>Pokemon with the Planter Capability
can act as a Portable Grower, holding one plant
at a time. Pokemon with this Capability may be 
limited in what they can grow. In these cases,
they will have parentheses on their Planter 
Capability denoting what they can grow.
For example, Planter (Berries) would allow
the Pokemon to grow Berry plants only.,</Description>
    </Capability>
    <Capability name="Premonition">
      <Description>Pokemon with this Capability
have a supernatural sense for natural
disasters such as earthquakes, floods,
and volcanic eruptions. The magnitude of
the impending disaster and its proximity to
the Pokemon both affect how often they get 
this sense before a disaster and how long in
advance the warning is. Closer and bigger 
disasters tend to have a greater effect 
and may alert the Pokemon to the specific
area where a disaster will occur days in
advance, while lesser disasters may simply
give the Pokemon an odd sense of unease 
several hours before they hit.,</Description>
    </Capability>
    <Capability name="Reach">
      <Description>A Pokemon with Reach has the
Range of their Melee attacks increased
based on their size category; Small and

Reforming is a Shift Action.,</Description>
    </Capability>
    <Capability name="Shapeshifter">
      <Description>Pokemon with this Capability 
can change their shape at will, taking on
different forms as a Standard Action.
When using this Capability, the user cannot
increase or decrease its total mass by more
than 50%, and they cannot replicate complex
machines such as computers or phones. They 
may take on the appearance of these devices, 
but they will appear simplified in comparison.
They can, however, transform into other moving 
forms such as acting as someone's prosthetic
limb, a living lever or pulley system, or
a Pokemon comparable in size. Note in this
last case that the Shapeshifter doesn't
gain any qualities of that Pokemon without 
actually using the Move Transform! Anyone
closely examining a Shapeshifter Pokemon 
may determine its true nature with a 
Perception Check opposed by the Pokemon's 
Stealth. If a Pokemon learns the Move 
Transform and does not have the Shapeshifter 
Capability, they gain Shapeshifter.,</Description>
    </Capability>
    <Capability name="Shrinkable">
      <Description>A Pokemon with the capability 
Shrinkable can shrink its size up to 25% of its 
normal size as a Standard Action, but this does
not change its weight. While Shrunken, a Pokemon
may not perform Standard Actions except to
return to normal size, and gains a +4 bonus

    </Capability>
    <Capability name="Telekinetic">
      <Description>Telekinetic Pokemon and 
Trainers can move objects with their
mind. They can lift things with 
Telekinesis as if they were using a
Power Capability equal to their Focus
Rank. When lifting Staggering Weights
with Telekinesis, they roll Focus instead 
of Athletics, and the DC is 10 instead of 4. 
They can target objects up to 8 meters away. 
Count the combined weight of all objects 
when determining whether they can lift 
all of them. Using this Capability to 
lift the user's Drag Weight or greater 
leaves discoverable psychic residue. 
Additionally, the user may use Struggle
Attacks at a range of X, where X is the 
user's Focus Rank. These Struggle Attack
s deal Normal-Type Damage as usual, but 
the user may add their Special Attack 
instead of their Attack and have the
attack deal Special Damage, if they wish.
The user may perform the Disarm, Trip, and
Push Maneuvers at the range of your Telekinetic 
Capability and using the Focus Skill for all
opposed rolls. When the Push Maneuver is used 
this way, the user does not repeat the Push but
instead Pushes the target a number of meters

e Telekinetic Capability, they gain
Telekinetic.,</Description>

meters away where X is Focus Rank doubled
. Pokemon with Telepathy can project their 
thoughts to the minds of other Trainers or
Pokemon with Telepathy. Trainers with Telepathy
can project their thoughts to the minds of any
Trainer or Pokemon. Telepathy can be used to read 
only one target at a time but can project to on a 
number of separate targets at once equal to half 
the user's Focus Rank. Telepathy may be used to 
read minds with or without making the target aware 
of the attempt. Unwilling targets and targets that
are unaware automatically resist the Telepathy
attempt; the user and target roll opposed
Focus Checks to determine if the Telepathy 
attempt is successful. A failure imposes a
